<h2># Arrays</h2>
<p> An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time. If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example)</p>
<br>
<h2># Avarage Numbers</h2>
<p>Finding the average value of a group of numbers is as easy as summing all of the numbers and dividing by the total number of numbers.</p>
<br>
<h2># Concat</h2>
<p> The concat method creates a new array consisting of the elements in the object on which it is called</p>
<br>
<h2># Constructor</h2>
<p>The constructor method is a special method of a class for creating and initializing an object of that class.</p>
<br>
<h2># Factory Function</h2>
<p>A factory function is any function which is not a class or constructor that returns a (presumably new) object. In JavaScript, any function can return an object. When it does so without the new keyword, it's a factory function</p>
<br>
<h2># Models</h2>
<p>JavaScript follows a similar model, but does not have a class definition separate from the constructor. Instead, you define a constructor function</p>
<br>
<h2># Prime Numbers</h2>
<p>A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number.</p>
<br>
<h2># Remove Array</h2>
<p>When you work with arrays, it is easy to remove elements and add new elements. This is what popping and pushing is</p>
<br>
<h2># Ternary Operator</h2>
<p>The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark ( ? ), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon ( : ), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy.</p>
